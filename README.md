*Executive Summary*
Develop a classification system that provides the navigational system user with an environmental impact rating for their route, varying based on mode of transport, time, distance, & location. 

*Proposal*
Our team will develop a classification system using machine learning methods that takes a user's location and destination, and outputs an environmental impact rating for the mode of transportation the traveler will use. This system will make use of live data factoring: traffic conditions, distance, location, alternative modes of transportation, & local fuel costs into producing an accurate rating. 

*Outcome*
The successful development and application of this system will allow users to make socially responsible decisions when traveling. Furthermore, the system may be integrated in currently developed navigation apps such as Apple "Maps" and "Google Maps" allowing for a broader reach and deeper user accessibility. This will not only promote environmental awareness on a larger scale but will also allow major tech companies to further participate in green initiatives. This system may also be useful in helping limit traffic, and allow governments to have more data to make decisions regarding public transportation funding.  

This system will not only promote individuals and companies to be more environmentally aware, but also actively promote greener travel choices.  

**Features**
*Delivery*
Initial delivery of the system will be via RShiny through RStudio. We hope eventually the rating system will be integrated into already established gps systems. The app will be available for free.

*EIR (Environmental Impact Rating)*
EIR is the standard we will develop and use to establish the level of impact each proposed route will make. For example, driving a car may have a rating of 'C' while walking may have a rating of 'A'

*User Personalization*
Each user will be allowed to input different aspects of their travel methods to further personalize the rating system to their lifestyles. For example, upon signing up a user will be given the option to enter the kind of vehicle the user regularly drives.  The EIR will take this into account and a rating for a Tesla may be very different from a rating a F-350 receives.
